We don‚Äôt provide email support for Hocuspocus, but if you have some legal issues, privacy or security concerns, send us an email to [humans@hocuspocus.dev](mailto:humans@hocuspocus.dev). For everything else, [please use GitHub issues](https://github.com/ueberdosis/hocuspocus-issues/issues). We‚Äôll make sure to get back to you quickly.

## List of external services
With that in mind, we still need a few external services to publish Hocuspocus. Let‚Äôs go through them one by one.

### Hosting (Netlify)
We use Netlify to host the documentation. It features continuous deployment from Git across a global application delivery network and full integration with Let‚Äôs Encrypt. If you want to know more, [read Netlify‚Äôs privacy policy](https://www.netlify.com/privacy/).

### Tracking (Plausible)
We use [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) to gain insight about our visitors in general. It doesn‚Äôt track individual users per se and does not store any personal identifiable information. [Go to their website](https://plausible.io/) to find out what Plausible collects (and more importantly what they don‚Äôt).

Or have a look at the [~~public~~ analytics dashboard](https://plausible.io/hocuspocus.dev) (soon) they provide. It‚Äôs not a stripped down version, it‚Äôs the exact same dashboard we use to check the traffic.

<!-- ### Search (Algolia)
We use [Algolia DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/) to offer search functionality for the documentation. They crawl the same pages as you see once every day. If you click on the search field on top of this page, their search interface pops up.

If you want to know more about what data they collect and process, [read their privacy policy](https://www.algolia.com/policies/privacy/). -->

## Suggesting alternatives
If you know a good self-hosted version of any of the mentioned services, create an issue on GitHub or send us an email to [humans@hocuspocus.dev](mailto:humans@hocuspocus.dev).
