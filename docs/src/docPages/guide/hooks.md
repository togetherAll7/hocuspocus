## Introduction

hocuspocus offers hooks to extend it's functionality and integrate it into existing applications. Hooks are configured as simple methods the same way as [other configuration options](/guide/configuration) are.

Hooks accept a hook payload as first argument. The payload is an object that contains data you can use and manipulate, allowing you to built complex things on top of this simple mechanic.

Hooks are required to return a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise), the easiest way to do that is to mark the function as `async`. (Node.js version must be greater or equal to 14)
