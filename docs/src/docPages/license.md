# License
In order to use hocuspocus, you must buy a license. You can buy a license at [our store](https://store.ueber.io).

* **Single developer licenses** are made for makers, developers, freelancers, webmasters and everyone who’s building something cool, but is the only one working with code.

* **Team licenses** are for teams, companies, organizations, whatever you call them. For everyone who’s building something amazing, together with one or more people working with code.

Both licenses enable you to install hocuspocus on multiple projects, domains, spin up as many instances as you need and download the package as often as you want.
