# hocuspocus
hocuspocus is a plug & play collaboration backend. It’s based on Y.js, a CRDT framework with a powerful abstraction of shared data.

You can use it, to keep multiple instances of text editors in sync, work offline and sync changes later, or sync text between different devices. Also, you can use it to build anything else, that needs to be collaboration, for example a collaborative drawing app.

## Features
**Conflict-free.** Y.js is a performant, conflict-free replicated data type implementation. Sync all your changes, no matter when they come in, they’ll be merged without conflicts.

**Well documented.** The documentation is a top priority for us, you’ll find a lot of guides, examples and even background knowledge here.

**Scalable.** You can spin up multiple instances of it and keep everything in sync with Redis. Support for Redis clusters is also baked-in.

**Actively maintained.** Hocuspocus comes with a price tag, but that ensures constant development, maintenance and suppport.

## License
